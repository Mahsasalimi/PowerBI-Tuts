# Power BI Learning Repository

Welcome to the Power BI Learning Repository! This repository is designed to help individuals learn how to create dynamic, interactive dashboards and reports using Power BI. Whether you're new to Power BI or looking to refine your data visualization skills, this collection will guide you through the fundamentals and advanced topics, offering hands-on examples and practical projects.

## Getting Started

To start exploring and learning Power BI using this repository, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

You can download the repository to your local machine by running the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mahsasalimi/PowerBI-Tuts
```

### 2. Download and Install Power BI Desktop

Ensure you have Power BI Desktop installed on your computer. If you haven’t installed it yet, download it from the official [Power BI website](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/).

### 3. Explore Power BI Files

The repository contains a collection of `.pbix` files (Power BI project files), each focusing on a different topic or concept. Open these files in Power BI Desktop to explore how different visualizations and reports are built.

### 4. Learn and Practice

Work through the provided `.pbix` files by navigating to the Reports, Data, and Model views in Power BI. Follow these steps:

- **Understand the Data Model**: Explore how the data is structured, including relationships between tables and the use of calculated columns or measures.
- **Analyze Visualizations**: Check out the visualizations created on the report pages. Hover over the elements to inspect the data and format settings.
- **Review DAX Formulas**: Examine the DAX formulas used for creating calculated fields and measures. Use these formulas as a learning resource for your own Power BI projects.
- **Experiment**: Modify the existing visualizations, or create new ones based on the available data. You can also import new datasets to practice your data modeling and visualization skills.

### 5. Refresh Data

Most Power BI files include sample data for demonstration purposes. However, you can refresh the data or connect your own data sources using Power BI's Get Data feature. This will allow you to apply the techniques learned here to your own datasets.

### 6. Publish and Share

Once you’ve built a report you're proud of, you can publish it to the Power BI Service and share it with others within your organization.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by topics related to Power BI, including:

- **Data Modeling**: Files and exercises on creating effective data models, including relationships, hierarchies, and calculated columns.
- **DAX Functions**: Explore the use of DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create powerful calculated measures and columns.
- **Visualizations**: Learn how to create a wide variety of visuals, from basic charts to advanced interactive dashboards.
- **Power Query**: Tutorials and examples on using Power Query to transform and clean data before loading it into Power BI.

Each topic directory contains Power BI project files (`*.pbix`), along with any relevant documentation or sample datasets.

## Sample Data

The sample datasets included in this repository are used for demonstration purposes only. Feel free to replace them with your own data for personalized learning and exploration.
